## Credentials path and management address[#](#credentials-path-and-management-address "Permalink to this headline")

The `credentials_path` and `mgmt_address` parameters are set by default in `/opt/cerebras/config` and typically do not require explicit specification.

An example configuration in `/opt/cerebras/config` might look like this:

```Bash
  {
  "clusters": [
          {
          "name": "system-name",
          "server": "1.2.3.4:9000",
          "authority": "cluster-server.system-name.example.com",
          "certificateAuthority": "/opt/cerebras/certs/tls.crt"
          }
  ],
  "contexts": [
          {
          "cluster": "cluster-name",
          "name": "system-name"
          }
  ],
  "currentContext": "system-name"
  }

```
## Python paths and mount directories[#](#python-paths-and-mount-directories "Permalink to this headline")

When running jobs, it’s crucial to include paths required by dataloaders and any external Python packages, as well as the location of the Cerebras Model Zoo.

Consider this directory structure as an example:

```Bash
  /path/to/datasets
        my_dataset/

  /path/to/modelzoo
          modelzoo

  /path/to/packages
          package_x
          package_y
```
If input workers need to access the “my_dataset” directory and require Python modules from the Model Zoo, “package_x”, and “package_y”, you would specify the command like this:

```Bash
  python run.py \
      CSX \
      --params params.yaml \
      --mode {train,eval,eval_all,train_and_eval} \
      --mount_dirs /path/to/datasets /path/to/modelzoo /path/to/packages \
      --python_paths /path/to/packages /path/to/modelzoo \

```

<Info>

Note

If some paths have a common parent folder, you only need to specify the parent in the `--mount_dirs` or `--python_paths arguments`. For instance, if the Model Zoo is at “/cb/home/user/modelzoo” and data is at “/cb/home/user/data”, you only need to specify `--mount_dirs /cb/home`.

</Info>

You can also set defaults for `mount_dirs` and `python_paths` in a YAML file and export it as an environment variable to streamline command line usage:

```Bash
export CEREBRAS_WAFER_SCALE_CLUSTER_DEFAULTS=/path/to/defaults/file.yaml
```
With this environment variable set, you won’t need to specify `--mount_dirs` and `--python_paths` when running a Cerebras Model Zoo job, unless you’re adding additional paths.
