## Overview[#](#overview "Permalink to this headline")

In the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster, in order to improve dataloading speeds, we can avoid network dataset streaming via the `create_worker_cache` function. This enables caching of a dataset to local SSD, which has significantly faster read speeds versus network.

## Procedure[#](#procedure "Permalink to this headline")

To enable worker_cache for a new dataloader, we need to ensure that data directory is added to the worker_cache on the worker node. The utility function `create_worker_cache` allows users to cache the directory on the worker node. It looks at the src directory, and caches this directory on the worker_cache if it doesn’t exist and there is enough space on the cache (shouldn’t exceed 80% after the directory is cached). It returns the path to the directory on the worker_cache.

Users just need to replace the returned directory with the original `data_dir` in the dataloader.

Users just need to replace the returned directory with the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data_dir</span></code> in the dataloader.

Note

The `create_worker_cache` should be called only for the worker task.
