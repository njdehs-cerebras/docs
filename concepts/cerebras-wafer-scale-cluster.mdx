## Key components

### CS-3 systems

The [CS-3 systems](https://www.cerebras.net/product-system/) represents the latest advancement in our lineup, incorporating the innovative WSE-3 (Wafer-Scale Engine 3) to deliver cutting-edge performance. Building on the user-friendly experience of its predecessor, the CS-2, the CS-3 significantly enhances computational efficiency and performance.

This next-gen system introduces a novel instruction set architecture and boosts the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) width, providing more parallel processing power. Additionally, it expands the core count by 20% and enhances the ingress/egress bandwidth by 30%, enabling faster data processing and transfer rates.

Compatibility and performance testing are a cornerstone of the CS-3’s development. All models available in the Model Zoo have been verified for functionality on the CS-3 platform. Furthermore, a selection of key models, including GPT-2, GPT-3, LLaMA, Falcon, BTLM, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, T5, BERT, and PaLI have undergone rigorous testing to ensure both convergence and performance are optimized for the CS-3, guaranteeing a seamless and efficient user experience. You can find more detailed information in the [WSE-3 datasheet](https://8968533.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8968533/Datasheets/WSE-3%20Datasheet.pdf) and explore [CS-3](https://www.cerebras.net/product-system/).

### CS-2 systems

These are the backbone of the cluster, featuring the powerful Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE). Each CS-2 node, mounted on a rack, is responsible for executing the core training and inference computations within a neural network. The CS-2 nodes not only house the WSE but also handle power management, cooling, and data delivery to the WSE. You can find more detailed information in the [WSE-2 datasheet](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/8968533/WSE-2%20Datasheet.pdf) datasheet and delve into the [CS-2 white paper](https://8968533.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8968533/Whitepapers/Cerebras-CS-2-Whitepaper.pdf) for a comprehensive understanding.

### MemoryX technology

[MemoryX technology](https://www.cerebras.net/blog/announcing-the-cerebras-architecture-for-extreme-scale-ai/) serves as the storage and intelligent streaming solution for a model’s weights, ensuring efficient and timely access for the CS-X systems.

### SwarmX technology

[SwarmX technology](https://www.cerebras.net/blog/announcing-the-cerebras-architecture-for-extreme-scale-ai/) plays a pivotal role in integrating multiple CS-X nodes into a unified Cerebras cluster. These nodes collaborate seamlessly in training a single model. SwarmX handles the broadcast of weights from MemoryX to the entire cluster and effectively reduces (sums) gradients in the opposite direction, contributing to efficient training processes.

### Input preprocessing servers

Input Preprocessing servers handle the critical task of preprocessing training data, ensuring that it is appropriately prepared before being dispatched to the CS-X systems. This preprocessing step is vital for training, inference, and evaluation.

### Management servers

Management servers are responsible for orchestrating and scheduling the cluster's resources, ensuring efficient utilization and coordination among all components in the Cerebras cluster. They play a key role in optimizing the cluster's performance and resource allocation.

## Working with the Cerebras Cluster

After developing your code, you can initiate the process of submitting it for both training and evaluation from a user node. It’s important to note that the user node operates independently from the cluster and connects to the Cerebras cluster through the management server, as illustrated in [Fig. 1](#topology-of-weight-streaming-on-wsc). The management server is responsible for handling all resource scheduling. Therefore, your main task is to specify the number of CS-X systems you wish to allocate for either training or evaluation. This enables you to efficiently utilize the Cerebras cluster’s resources without directly managing the intricacies of cluster allocation.
