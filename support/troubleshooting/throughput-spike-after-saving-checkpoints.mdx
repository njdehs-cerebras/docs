description: "If you notice a throughput spike after saving checkpoints, this is a known artifact of reporting throughput on the user node, caused by the asynchronous nature of execution on Wafer-Scale Cluster. For more details and understanding of this behavior, please refer to [Measure throughput of your model](../Fundamentals/rate_global_rate.html#rate-global-rate)."
