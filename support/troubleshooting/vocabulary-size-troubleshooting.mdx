## Large vocabulary size[#](#large-vocabulary-size "Permalink to this headline")

Vocabulary size up to one million tokens is supported. Large vocabulary (~1M) may take up to 90 minutes to compile. Large vocabulary sizes have not been fully tested on models with 2.7 billion parameter models or more.

If you see something similar to the following error, it might be due to the vocabulary being too large.

### Observed Error[#](#observed-error "Permalink to this headline")

```bash

RuntimeError: [enforce fail at alloc_cpu.cpp:66] . DefaultCPUAllocator: can't allocate memory: you tried to allocate 9120000000000 bytes
```
## Small vocabulary size[#](#small-vocabulary-size "Permalink to this headline")


Compilation errors may occur at extremely small vocabulary sizes (e.g., < 4).
