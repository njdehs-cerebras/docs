## Overview[#](#overview "Permalink to this headline")

The Cerebras documentation provides a thorough overview of core workflows essential for AI model development and deployment:

*   The [Quickstart Guide For Data Preprocessing](quick-start-guide.html) guide offers a streamlined introduction to preparing data for training.
    
*   The [Pre-training](pretrain.html) and [fine-tuning](finetuning.html) workflows are detailed, enabling users to effectively train and optimize their models.
    
*   Specialized workflows for downstream tasks, such as the [BigCode Eval Harness (BCEH)](downstream_bceh.html) and [Eleuther Eval Harness (EEH)](downstream_eeh.html), are included for targeted applications.
    
*   The [Pretraining with Upstream Validation](pretrain_downstream.html) tutorial includes downstream validation for your pre-training run. Additionally, the [multi-phase](multi_phase.html) and [summary](summaries.html) sections offer guidance on managing complex training processes and summarizing results, ensuring comprehensive support for every stage of model development.
