## Model portability

The [Cerebras Model Zoo](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo) facilitates model portability, providing tools that aid users in adapting existing models or crafting new ones using Cerebras APIs. This includes a spectrum of user stages, from beginners to advanced users, with varying levels of integration and customization:

**Beginners**

Start with Cerebras [data preprocessing tools](../port/prepare-data/dataloader_pt.html#dataloader-pt-mz) and use model implementations found in the [Cerebras Model Zoo](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo).

**Intermediate Users**

Intermediate users can integrate their data preprocessing methods by referring to the section [Create your own data preprocessing](../port/prepare-data/dataloader_pt.html#dataloader-pt-custom).

**Advanced Users**

Define your PyTorch model or code using the `run` function in the [Cerebras Model Zoo](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo) and [Supported Operations API](../port/define-model/modules.html#supported-ops).

## Modules overview

The Model Zoo’s structure is designed to be user-friendly, offering an organized array of models, datasets, tools, and utilities. Features include:

Key features of the Cerebras Model Zoo include:

* Reorganized models and datasets categorized by classes (**NLP**, **Vision**, **Multimodal**).

* Registry APIs that enable querying of paths and supported combinations for each model.

* Config classes designed to encapsulate parameters in YAML files, providing a clear class hierarchy and ensuring the validation of configurations used with models.

* Enhanced data preprocessing tools for NLP models, significantly improving performance.


With the reorganization, paths within the Model Zoo have been updated. Users should refer to the updated documentation to align their projects with the new structure.

The structure of the Cerebras Model Zoo is illustrated in the diagram below:
